manually merge sort your favourite djmax respect songs

## Developer notes

All of the song data is found at [src/fnc_data_song.js](./src/fnc_data_song.js), defined in the array `ary_SongData`. Each song's data is an array with a specific number of elements; for example:

```json
[1, "2Nite", [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], "https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/960170/capsule_616x353.jpg", "xuBQ7dGdj_s", "Respect", "DMR", "ND Lee", REGULAR_SONG],
```

The elements, in order, are as follows:

1. Nothing useful, but we just have `1` here by convention.
2. Song title.
3. A 1:1 mapping to `ary_TitleData`. If the element at index `i` is 1, then it belongs to the game/album with the title `ary_TitleData[i]`.
4. A url for an image for the game to which the song belongs.
5. YouTube video ID.
6. Game/album full title.
7. Game/album abbreviated title.
8. Song artist
9. `1` if a regular song, `2` if V exclusive, `3` if link disc.
10. `1` if short/non-extended mix, `2` if an extended mix.
